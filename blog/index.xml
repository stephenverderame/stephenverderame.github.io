In high school, building such a fast and accurate collision engine eluded me. This post describes, conceptually, the algorithm I settled upon when developing Project Oort. I will assume a basic familiarity with the problem of collision detection, including bounding spheres and axis-aligned bounding boxes, simple data structures like trees, and the basics of concrete linear algebra including vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.</description></item><item><title>The Case of the Disappearing Shadow: Gradual Shadow Fading</title><link>https://stephenverderame.github.io/blog/oort-shadows/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 08:38:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://stephenverderame.github.io/blog/oort-shadows/</guid><description>When implementing the cloaking ability for Project Oort, I came upon a somewhat interesting problem: At what point during the gradual disappearing process should the object&amp;rsquo;s shadow disappear?
At first, I just had the object abruptly stop writing to the depth buffer at a certain transparency threshold. This would cause the shadow to simply cut out at an arbitrary point. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the look of that and decided that I wanted the shadow to fade in and out gradually.</description></item></channel></rss>
