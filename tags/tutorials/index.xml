Moreover, avoiding extra runtime costs would be extremely nice as well, especially for systems programming domains.
I recently began working on an LLVM pass which aims to guarantee the absence of loading and storing of null pointers.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time, Accurate Collision Detection</title><link>https://stephenverderame.github.io/blog/oort-collisions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephenverderame.github.io/blog/oort-collisions/</guid><description>Accurate collision detection is a vital part of video games and simulation, and fast collision detection is paramount for real-time applications such as games. In high school, building such a fast and accurate collision engine eluded me. This post describes, conceptually, the algorithm I settled upon when developing Project Oort. I will assume a basic familiarity with the problem of collision detection, including bounding spheres and axis-aligned bounding boxes, simple data structures like trees, and the basics of concrete linear algebra including vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.</description></item></channel></rss>
