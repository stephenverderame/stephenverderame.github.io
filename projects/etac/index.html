I took it during Spring 2023 and as part of this class, I worked in a group
of 4 to implement an optimizing compiler for a C-like language
<a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2023sp/project/language.pdf?1681909895>Eta</a>
which would eventually get extended to become
<a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2023sp/project/rlang.pdf?1681919236>Rho</a>.
It compiles into x86_64 and we only got around to supporting the System V calling
convention.</p><p>We implemented our compiler in Java (although one of my teammates and I
were tempted to use Rust) using the CUP parser generator and JFlex lexer generator.
The result ended up being over 20,000 lines of code (excluding tests in eta/rho
itself).</p><p>The project itself was tons of fun and I meant to expand upon it over the following
Summer but got a bit caught up with internships and such. We ended up doing fairly well,
and although we didn&rsquo;t podium in the final competition, we did get
a high score based on correctness, completion, and style with the original test
suite the course staff used for grading.</p><p>One thing I was particularly proud of was our tiling implementation. We used
dynamic programming for optimal tiling, and a double visitor hierarchy which
essentially boiled down to a form of triple method dispatch so that we can
easily create tile patterns to match subtrees in the IR AST. This is
because we had one set of visitors visiting the pattern tree, another set
of visitors visiting the AST, and a final aggregate visitor visiting both trees
simultaneously. We composed patterns
and developed template patterns to easily add new instructions with minimal effort and
without code duplication. One such template pattern matches any
memory expression and converts it to the most optimal x86 addressing mode it can.
So <code>MEM(X + Y * 4)</code> becomes <code>[X + Y * 4]</code> while <code>MEM(X + Y * Z)</code> would have to
become something like</p><pre tabindex=0><code>mov _t0, Y
imul _t0, Z
mov ..., [X + _t0]
</code></pre><p>Then, when building tiles for something like an add, we could construct a pattern
tree like:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>ADD(
    ARG_PATTERN1,
    ARG_PATTERN2,
    CommutativePattern,
    MaxOneMemoryAccess
)
</code></pre><p>Another part of the compiler I was proud of was our implementation of Chaitin-Briggs
register allocation. We could have implemented Linear Scan register allocation,
but I thought it would be tons of fun to implement Chaitin-Briggs. So that&rsquo;s what
I did. I very loosely followed the discussion in Professor Appel&rsquo;s
<a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2023sp/project/language.pdf?1681909895>Modern Compiler Implementation in Java</a>. It took a few attempts but after getting it working without Register Spilling, I was quite surprised to discover I managed to add that final part of the algorithm on the first try.</p><p>Unfortunately, with 5 hours until the deadline, while running a provided
Mandelbrot fractal test program, I discovered that there was some error that
we didn&rsquo;t catch in all our unit tests. We tried going through the 5,000+ lines of
assembly our compiler generated and isolating suspicious code into unit tests, but we
were unable to find the bug in time. :(</p><p>Some things I worked on:</p><ul><li>Instruction selection, and tiling</li><li>Chaitin-Briggs Register Allocation with move coalescing</li><li>conditional copy/constant propagation, dead code elimination, live variables analysis,
value numbering</li><li>Syntax-directed IR translation and type-checking</li><li>Parser specification</li></ul><p>I cannot share the code as it would violate academic integrity.</p></div><div class=container><hr></div><div class="container has-text-centered top-pad"><a href=#top><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></div><div class=container><hr></div><div class=section id=footer><div class="container has-text-centered"><span class=footer-text><a href=https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-introduction/><strong>Introduction</strong></a> theme for <a href=http://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
