I worked in a group
of 4 to implement an optimizing compiler for a C-like language
<a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2023sp/project/language.pdf?1681909895 target=_blank>Eta</a>
which would eventually get extended to become
<a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2023sp/project/rlang.pdf?1681919236 target=_blank>Rho</a>.
It compiles into x86_64 and we only got around to supporting the System V calling
convention.</p><p>We implemented our compiler in Java (although one of my teammates and I
were tempted to use Rust) using the CUP parser generator and JFlex lexer generator.
The result ended up being over 20,000 lines of code (excluding tests in eta/rho
itself).</p><p>The project itself was tons of fun and I meant to expand upon it over the following
Summer but got a bit caught up with internships and such. We ended up doing fairly well,
and although we didn&rsquo;t podium in the final competition, we did get
a high score based on correctness, completion, and style with the original test
suite the course staff used for grading.</p><p>One thing I think we did well was our tiling implementation. We used
dynamic programming for optimal tiling and a double visitor hierarchy which
essentially boiled down to a form of triple method dispatch so that we can
easily create tile patterns to match subtrees in the IR AST. This is
because we had one set of visitors visiting the pattern tree, another set
of visitors visiting the AST, and a final aggregate visitor visiting both trees
simultaneously. I suppose the challenge really came from striving for utmost
reusability and cleanliness in a language without pattern matching.
We composed patterns
and developed template patterns to easily add new instructions with minimal effort and
without code duplication. One such template pattern matches any
memory expression and converts it to the most optimal x86 addressing mode it can.
So <code>MEM(X + Y * 4)</code> becomes <code>[X + Y * 4]</code> while <code>MEM(X + Y * Z)</code> would have to
become something like</p><pre tabindex=0><code>mov _t0, Y
imul _t0, Z
mov ..., [X + _t0]
</code></pre><p>Then, when building tiles for something like an add, we could construct a pattern
tree like:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>ADD(
    ARG_PATTERN1,
    ARG_PATTERN2,
    CommutativePattern,
    MaxOneMemoryAccess
)
</code></pre><p>Another part of the compiler I was proud of was our implementation of
<a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/989393.989403 target=_blank>Chaitin-Briggs register allocation</a>.
We could have implemented <a href=https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs132/linearscan.pdf target=_blank>Linear Scan</a> register allocation,
but I thought it would be tons of fun to implement Chaitin-Briggs. So that&rsquo;s what
I did. I very loosely followed the discussion in Professor Appel&rsquo;s
<a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2023sp/project/language.pdf?1681909895 target=_blank>Modern Compiler Implementation in Java</a>. It took a few attempts but after getting it working without Register Spilling, I was quite surprised to discover I managed to add that final part of the algorithm on the first try.</p><p>Unfortunately, with 5 hours until the deadline, while running a provided
Mandelbrot fractal test program, I discovered that there was some error that
we didn&rsquo;t catch in all our unit tests. We tried going through the 5,000+ lines of
assembly our compiler generated and isolating suspicious code into unit tests, but we
were unable to find the bug in time. :(</p><p>Some things I worked on:</p><ul><li>Instruction selection, and tiling</li><li>Chaitin-Briggs Register Allocation with move coalescing</li><li>conditional copy/constant propagation, dead code elimination, live variables analysis,
value numbering</li><li>Syntax-directed IR translation and type-checking</li><li>Parser specification</li></ul></section></div><button class="modal-close is-large" aria-label=close data-target=#project-0></button></div><div class=modal id=project-1><div class=modal-background></div><div class=modal-card style=width:50vw><header class="modal-card-header bottom-pad"><h1 class="modal-card-title has-text-centered">Project Oort</h1></header><div style=display:table-row;width:100%><span class=fa-xs style=display:table-cell;white-space:nowrap>Jan 2022 - June 2023</span>

is somewhat similar to a camel, as in OCaml. The preprocessing language part was because originally
the plan was for SAPL to be a preprocessor to any arbitrary language such as C or
Javascript.</p><p>The language has features of imperative languages such as loops, classes, interfaces,

for the 22-23 school year. For my senior year, I&rsquo;ve decided to take a bit of a
backseat role to make sure I have time for other things I want to do
this year such as research.</p><p>We compete every year in the University Rover Challenge, held in Utah.</p><p>During my time on the team, I:</p><ul><li>Led a team of 12 to iteratively develop software for a rover using ROS (Robot Operating System), C++,
and Python</li><li>Redesigned the codebase to focus on code quality, maintainability, documentation, testing, readability, and reliability</li><li>Created a runtime fault handling and dependency management system, and wrote a 300+ page Modern C++ reference guide</li><li>Improved the pathfinding algorithm to support the autonomous location of AR tags and traversal through goalposts</li><li>Implemented a multithreaded hardware abstraction layer and a communication format to support greater message throughput to the microcontroller. This improved performance by over 400%, reduced code coupling, and drastically increased testability</li></ul><h3 id=ascii-hw-message-format-first-year class=anchor-link><a href=#ascii-hw-message-format-first-year>ASCII HW Message Format (First Year)</a></h3><p>The first thing I worked on was implementing the CS side of a new message
format that transmitted messages to the microcontroller managed by the electrical
subteam. The previous year, the team decided to switch from a binary to an
ASCII representation for easier debugging.</p><h3 id=concurrent-hardware-abstraction-layer-first-year class=anchor-link><a href=#concurrent-hardware-abstraction-layer-first-year>Concurrent Hardware Abstraction Layer (First Year)</a></h3><p>After the message format, I was tasked with improving message throughput
so that our HW abstraction layer could handle the number of messages
sent by the inverse kinematics controller for the arm, which was new
the previous year.</p><p>To do this, my first thought was to use asynchronous programming (in fact,
the project was dubbed Async HAL), however, this would require changing
a lot of the code that interfaced with HAL which was written with
sequential communication in mind. Since we used ROS, each module in our
software was run in separate processes (known as nodes), which communicate over
two-way channels known as actions. Therefore, what I ended up doing was
multithreading the action server with a thread pool that handles action requests on the HAL side so
that many clients can send requests at once. So for each request, the action server
would push the request onto a thread pool to be processed in parallel with other
requests.</p><p>Of course, we still only had one port going to the actual HW. To work around this,
I designed a new port interface for reading and writing data and a port decorator
which made accessing a decorated port thread-safe. This was achieved by having
all calls to write to the port copy the message into a shared buffer and having
a single thread handle sending the buffered messages to the HW. Reading was done
similarly but in reverse with a single thread reading the port and distributing
the messages to the correct client threads by matching message IDs of the SW requests
and HW responses.</p><p><img src=/projects/HAL_control_flow.png alt=HAL></p><p>The new port interface also allowed SW testing. All we had to do was create
a port that would read and write a memory buffer, and the complex logic
of the decorator could be tested by decorating the memory port.</p><p>Things did not go smoothly though. I stumbled through bugs caused by race
conditions for over three months where I was a slave to the green <code>PASSED</code>
and red <code>FAILED</code> messages of my unit tests. I don&rsquo;t remember what eventually fixed it,
but I think it had something to do with calling a function
that, unbeknownst to me, yielded control back to ROS.</p><h3 id=autonomy-refactor-second-year class=anchor-link><a href=#autonomy-refactor-second-year>Autonomy Refactor (Second Year)</a></h3><p>During my sophomore year, I updated our autonomy algorithm
to support passing through goalposts instead of just arriving near an AR tag.
While doing this, I also refactored and completely reimplemented the algorithm
using the State design pattern.</p><p>We use ROS to handle the obstacle avoidance and navigation to GPS coordinates,
but it is up to us to implement the logic so that our rover can search for AR tags
and navigate through goals.</p><p>Our algorithm revolves around a simple, yet very clever and effective idea that
I won&rsquo;t disclose.</p><p>I have some design documents and presentations I wrote describing this in more
detail, but cannot share them here.</p><h3 id=fault-handling-third-year class=anchor-link><a href=#fault-handling-third-year>Fault Handling (Third Year)</a></h3><p>As the subteam lead, I didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot of implementation work
during my third year. However, one thing I did do was create a decentralized
fault-handling system.</p><p>The core idea is that we have a dependency graph of nodes. We never want
a node to be running when something it depends on is not running, and we&rsquo;d like no nodes whose sole purpose was to serve another node to be running when the
system they exist to support is not alive.</p><p>To achieve this goal, when a node starts up, it activates its chain
of dependencies in topological order and waits until all dependencies
are running before continuing. On error, the node would do a similar process,
notifying all nodes it supports that they must shut down and all nodes that support
it that a depender is shutting down. After a few seconds, a fault handler would
attempt to restart all of the shutdown nodes in topological order.</p><h3 id=subteam-lead-third-year class=anchor-link><a href=#subteam-lead-third-year>Subteam Lead (Third Year)</a></h3><p>My main role was working with the other subteams on integration,
assigning tasks, providing guidance, and other miscellaneous work.</p><p>This year, we were migrating from ROS 1 to ROS 2 which entailed
reimplementing everything. We focused a lot more on using
ROS libraries to avoid the extra work.</p><p>At the beginning of the year, I set up a lot of DevOps stuff:</p><ul><li>Doxygen-generated code docs</li><li>Switched over to Clang, Clang-tidy, Clang-format</li><li>Created formatting rules loosely based on Google&rsquo;s style guide</li><li>Established linting rules and a coding standard</li><li>Created a Python unit testing library on top of Pytest</li><li>Setup a CI and nightlies with Github Actions</li></ul><p>I also introduced a new Agile-ish development model that focused on iterative
development instead of the old, design-implement-test workflow that would
delay testing until the spring. We used 3-4 week-long sprints, where I would
help break up everybody&rsquo;s projects into tasks that can be accomplished in
a few weeks. I found it helpful to scope some tasks ahead of time in order to be
able to provide resources and some insight into a direction to attack the problem.
These changes, along with
a greater focus on early SW testing in the simulation
were well-received by the team.</p><p>We met for three, 2-hour work sessions a week along with independent work.
While I was initially opposed to that much &ldquo;oversight&rdquo;, we found the designated
work times to be really helpful to avoid getting too busy with other classes,
and a set period where I am available to answer questions in person also proved useful.</p><hr></section></div><button class="modal-close is-large" aria-label=close data-target=#project-4></button></div><div class=modal id=project-5><div class=modal-background></div><div class=modal-card style=width:50vw><header class="modal-card-header bottom-pad"><h1 class="modal-card-title has-text-centered">Strava Activity Log</h1></header><div style=display:table-row;width:100%><span class=fa-xs style=display:table-cell;white-space:nowrap>Summer 2020</span>

used to provide the Training Log to free users. When they
made this a premium feature, I was a tad annoyed and decided to try to
implement it myself. To my delight, Strava provides all the necessary
information available through its <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST target=_blank>REST API</a>.</p><p>As an Android user, I got to work developing an Android app that would
give me back my beloved training log. I previously developed a C++ program
that would visualize rides in 3D, so I rolled that feature in as well.
I also developed a graphing feature that can aggregate stats over multiple
activities while I was at it.</p><p>With a hastily designed logo, the result was
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sev.activitylog" target=_blank>Activity Log</a>,
an app that:</p><ul><li>Displays activities in 3D with dynamic lights and shadows</li><li>Displays activities on a calendar and provides weekly summaries like Strava&rsquo;s Training Log</li><li>Computes aggregate statistics over arbitrary time frames</li><li>Graphs aggregate statistics</li></ul><p>Some Technical Info:</p><ul><li>MVC architecture</li><li>Blinn-Phong lighting model in OpenGLES</li><li>Custom graph Android fragment</li><li>A heap to cache satellite images from HERE Satellite Imagery and elevation data
from OpenTopo</li></ul><p>I will admit that Strava got the last laugh because, about a year after completing
this project, I decided to subscribe to Strava Premium anyway to get live segments
on my Garmin, plus some other cool features. Somewhat recently, they also added
a pretty nice 3D view which is far superior to what I did in this app.</p><a href=https://github.com/stephenverderame/ActivityLog target=_blank><div style=text-align:center><i class="fab fab fa-github"></i><br>Source</div></a></section></div><button class="modal-close is-large" aria-label=close data-target=#project-5></button></div><div class=modal id=project-6><div class=modal-background></div><div class=modal-card style=width:50vw><header class="modal-card-header bottom-pad"><h1 class="modal-card-title has-text-centered">Puzzle Solver</h1></header><div style=display:table-row;width:100%><span class=fa-xs style=display:table-cell;white-space:nowrap>Summer 2018</span>

a maze and word-search solver in C++. I based my implementation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&amp;t" target=_blank>3Blue1Brown’s Recent Videos</a> and learned necessary
topics in computer vision and linear algebra along the way.</p><p>The code for this project
is a mess, and I just keep this project on my site as an interesting archive artifact.</p><p>The mazes were rather straightforward: select a starting and end point
and run A* over a greyscale image. The word searches, however,
were rather tricky and utilized a feed-forward neural network for optical character recognition.</p><p>The overall process was as follows:</p><ol><li>Convert image to greyscale</li><li>Perform Canny Edge Detection (Guassian Blur + Sobel Edge Detection + Post Processing) to highlight edges</li><li>Perfom a Hough Transform on the result of the Canny Edge Detection to identify &ldquo;grid lines&rdquo;</li><li>Compute the intersection points of the lines detected by the Hough Transform</li><li>For each line intersection (which will occur mostly at locations of letters), try to find a bounding box containing some character. Next, to filter out intersections not part of the grid:</li><li>Use a red-black tree to sort x values, y values, distance between x values and distance between y values of each bounding box computed from each line intersection</li><li>Use sorted inorder-traversal of the trees to compute medians of the above values</li><li>Use the sorted lists to find groups of relatively equal spacing between elements. The largest group of equal spacing is assumed to be the search grid</li><li>For each bounding box, draw a point at its center and perform the hough transform again to find grid lines and place the bounding boxes into the search grid</li><li>Converts the pixels of each bounding box from Matrix to Vector format, and passes the vector through the Neural Network to calculate its predicted letter value</li><li>Finds the words specified in the WordSearchDialog by naive brute-force search
over the grid</li></ol><p>One thing to note is that I chose a tree sort using a red-black tree simply because I
wanted to learn how to implement balanced binary trees. This proved quite useful
as later in my functional programming class I would learn
<a href=https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150FP/archive/chris-okasaki/redblack99.pdf target=_blank>Osaki’s Red-Black Tree Implementation</a>
and be blown away by the reduction in complexity compared to my imperative implementation
in this project.</p><h3 id=demo class=anchor-link><a href=#demo>Demo</a></h3><video controls>

didn&rsquo;t have any CS classes at the time), but history. A huge part of that was
my teacher for AP European History, who had a huge impact on me and whom I consider
to be one of my role models to this day.</p><p>Well, in 2017 I decided I wanted to step away from high-level graphics libraries
like SDL and Java Swing, and learn OpenGL. The culmination of my hard work
was <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/kfbr/home target=_blank>KFBR</a>, a first-person multiplayer battle royale
(recall Fortnite and PUBG just came out). KFBR, King Frederick&rsquo;s Battle Royale
was named after
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William_I_of_Prussia target=_blank>King Frederick I of Prussia</a>, the
military-obsessed father of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_the_Great target=_blank>Frederick the Great</a>.
Allegedly, on his deathbed bed Frederick I had his &ldquo;blue boys&rdquo; (soldiers) parade
around him. The game was originally KHBR, named after King Henry VIII,
but I felt that it would be more like Frederick I to host a Hunger Games-style
battle royale.</p><p>One thing I wasn&rsquo;t able to figure out was good collision detection and I settled
for manually (and poorly) placed AABBs. However, I vowed to return to this problem
and years later I did with Project Oort.</p><p>Some technical implementations:</p><ul><li>TCP server and client</li><li>Blinn-Phong lighting model and shadow mapping from a directional light source</li><li>Static model loading, skyboxes, blur</li></ul><p>The code is an absolute mess, and I just keep this project here for an interesting data point in my historical archive.</p><h3 id=demo class=anchor-link><a href=#demo>Demo</a></h3><video controls>
